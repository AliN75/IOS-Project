# IOS-Project
This Project includes two parts. First part is implementation of a simple machine learning model. There is a library that converts some specific machine learning models into the models can be used in xcode and IOS programming called CoreML. I have decided to choose a simple model for two reasons and I had to change my project. First, we want to implement a model that can be used easily in IOS programming and be enough simple to user. Second, although CoreML library is a useful tool for converting machine learning models, it has lots of limitations of machine learning versions that it supports. For example, I couldn’t convert Tensorflow model. Also I’ve faced strange errors while implementing complicated models. Finally, I’ve chose a simple linear model and it had an acceptable performance on data surprisingly. For implementation, I’ve used data from a famous competition in “Kaggle”. Second part of my project is working with IOS and create an interface for users to import their own information and see their house price prediction on the screen.
